   The bright side One of the positive changes that accompanies artificial intelligence is the rapid increase in productivity and achievements of mankind by enhancing existing skills, providing the best customer service, improving the pace of employment and choosing employment. New types of jobs will emerge and the robot and other machines will perform daily routine tasks in a professional manner, saving time and effort for employees to waste them on simple things. As for consumers, they will benefit from artificial intelligence in the form of improving services, providing recommendations and quality with high efficiency in addition to making substantial and tangible changes in industries such as health care, transportation and medicine in a safer way. Of course, human life will change for the better from the presence of self-driving cars
   Of course, human life will change for the better from the presence of self-driving cars and the expansion of this technology to other means of transportation such as trains, ships and airplanes. It is expected that companies will reduce many expenses thanks to artificial intelligence and its applications that are increasing day after day, in addition to the new innovations and innovations that accompany this technology that will strongly affect daily life. As with any emerging technology that appears in the light, there is a controversy over artificial intelligence from time to time, as there are many industries that have caused widespread controversy when they appear, such as cars and airplanes.
   On the dark side in the coming years, artificial intelligence will raise three questions the first of its effects on jobs, given that companies and industrial and service sectors are moving towards this technology to reduce costs through reducing employment. Artificial intelligence can carry out customer service and human resource functions. According to the McKinsey study, 375 million jobs or 14% of the global workforce may be automated by 2030. And the second question: “How will privacy be protected with the spread of artificial intelligence? This question enters the scope and circulation of data on the Internet and tracks human behaviors digital moment by moment. And artificial intelligence will allow customers, employees and consumers to be monitored effectively and learn about their behavior, but at the same time, it will violate their privacy and data.
   There will be a need to enact new legislation regulating this. The third question is about the effects of artificial intelligence on competitiveness in the business sectors where many companies try to add tools supported by artificial intelligence to enhance their productivity and the skills of their employees and provide good services. And when all companies accelerate the application of this technology at a widespread pace, this may adversely affect competitiveness, as the services will be similar from company to company. Among the dark aspects of artificial intelligence is the possibility of increasing monopoly in some industries outside the technology sector by attracting the greatest amount of technical talent and killing creativity in the human element
